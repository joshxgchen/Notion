# NOTE: Page ID did not work for me. Any time I tried to use pageID to update values to help with deterministic values, it returned not found. This is necessary for the update method in Notion's API, so to compensate I had to use a set() of already existing books as a mimiced solution. It is not perfect, but it's the best I could do, and I mentioned this to my recruiter Chris


# Considerations / Edge Cases: [âœ… == done in my solution]

# We need the columns to be Book Name, Average Rating, and Favourites EXACTLY. 

# 1. What if the CSV file is very large? (e.g. 1 million rows) - One solution is to read and process the .csv file in smaller chunks to avoid memory issues

# 2. Notion API changes - There is a risk if Notion changes its API, but we can mitigate this by reading the Notion API documentation and using the latest version of Pythn and the Python Notion SDK

# 3. âœ… What if the CSV has invalid data? - We can use a try/except block to catch any invalid data and skip over it. I did this in my solution with rating, but could check the names as well. 

# 4. âœ… What if the CSV file is not found? - We checked this with the try catch block!

# 5. What if the CSV file has duplicate data? - We can use a set() to store the data, which will automatically remove any duplicates.

# 6. âœ… What if the CSV file has a different number of columns? - We can check the length of each row and skip over any rows that don't have the correct number of columns. I did this in my solution.

# 7. What if the CSV file has a different delimiter [e.g. a question mark]? - We can specify the delimiter when we open the file.

# 8. What if there are multiple CSV files? - We can use a for loop to iterate over each file and process them one by one. 

# 9. âœ… What if the CSV block is empty? - We can check the size of the file and skip over it if it is empty. I did this :)!

# 10. What if concurrent operations are done? - We can use a lock to ensure that only one operation is done at a time, to prevent conflicts.
